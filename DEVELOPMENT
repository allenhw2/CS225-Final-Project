WEEK1 (11/15/20 - 11/22/20):
This week our group finished the team contract and discussed the logistics for completing the project. Additionally, 
we looked through the dataset and decided to use a road map dataset for our graph. We discussed and completed the 
project goals document. Although we have not gotten feedback on the proposal, we began to discuss implementation 
details and ways that the work could be delegated.

WEEK2 (11/23/20 - 11/29/20):
This was fall/thanksgiving break so we didn't due that much. We got together on Friday the 27th to plan out who is doing
what and the order of tasks that need to be done. We also implemented a skeleton of the file structure that was decided 
during our meeting. We decided to base the graph/edge structure off the CS 225 lab ml and lab flow.

WEEK 3 (11/30/20 - 12/6/20):
- 12/2/20 Meeting 1: We all gathered for a meeting to go and work on the code together. Bella worked on the traversals while
    three were trying to fix the kinks in our graph code and the djikstra algorithm. We have established plans to meet later 
    again in the day to continue our work. 
- 12/2/20 Meeting 2: We continued to work on djikstra's algorithm and got it working on a smaller dataset. We still are running
    into issues with the full official dataset, but plan to continue working on it this week. 
- 12/5/20:
    A* has been completed, djikstra still needs work. We utilized Python to add random weights to the dataset. We still need to change 
    the data structure to a priority queue and implement tests. TODO: djikstra, Tests, Edge cases

Our group had our check-in meeting on 12/5/20 and received feedback about implementation and overall progress. We are on track to finish
the project by the due date and have a clear idea of the things that we need to complete this upcoming week.

WEEK 4 (12/7/20 - 12/11/20):
- 12/8/20: We met to go and work on our leftover work. We started on the presentation and got a good start on the results 
    document. Additionally, our group split up working on code documentation/structure and adding tests.
- 12/9/20: Met up today in the afternoon to go and figure out why our code was printing the last node twice, discovered it was an issue with the iterator.
  We met up again later in the day to record the final presentation, go over the results document, and ensure that we had
  everything together.
- 12/11/20: Our group texted throughout the day to ensure that everything was uploaded and complete. We also fixed a small issue
with the BFS operator and completed our group evaluations.
